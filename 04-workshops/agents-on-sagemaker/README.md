# Build Agentic Workflows with Small Language Models and SageMaker AI

This workshop contains examples of how to build Agentic Workflows using reasoning models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI and deploy the worflow to Bedrock AgentCore runtime.

In [Lab 1](./lab1/) we will deploy [Qwen3-4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B) model on real-time Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint using Large Model Inference (LMI) container.

In [Lab 2](./lab2/) we will create a simple MCP server, integrate it with MCP gateway, create research agent and finally deploy the agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
