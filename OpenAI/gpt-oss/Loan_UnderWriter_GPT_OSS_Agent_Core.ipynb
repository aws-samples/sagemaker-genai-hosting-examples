    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will describe how to deploy an existing agent to AgentCore runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, we will use a LangGraph agent using Amazon SageMaker with OpenAI GPT-OSS models for intelligent loan underwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will use a sophisticated loan analysis agent with three specialized tools:\n",
    "- `parse_loan_application` - Extracts structured data from conversational loan applications\n",
    "- `analyze_creditworthiness` - Performs comprehensive financial analysis and risk assessment  \n",
    "- `make_final_decision` - Makes approval/denial decisions with detailed loan terms\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow that transforms natural language loan requests into professional underwriting decisions with calculated interest rates, monthly payments, and risk evaluations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we begin building our loan underwriting agent, you'll need to deploy the OpenAI GPT-OSS model using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.\n",

    "**Required Setup:**\n",
    "1. Open the notebook `openai_gpt_oss.ipynb` in the `./deploy_sagemaker/gpt-oss` folder\n",
    "2. Follow the instructions to deploy the GPT-OSS model to a SageMaker endpoint\n",

    "4. Return to this notebook once your SageMaker endpoint is successfully deployed\n",

    "\n",
    "Before deploying our loan underwriting agent to Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, we need to create an IAM role with \n",

    "\n",
    "• **Invoke your SageMaker endpoint** for GPT-OSS model inference  \n",
    "• **Manage ECR repositories** for storing container images  \n",
    "• **Write CloudWatch logs** for monitoring and debugging  \n",
    "• **Access Bedrock AgentCore workload services** for runtime operations  \n",
    "• **Send telemetry data** to X-Ray and CloudWatch for observability  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a comprehensive IAM role with five custom policies plus the AWS managed \n",
    "AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy. Each policy is scoped to only the resources needed for AgentCore operations, \n",
    "following the principle of least privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "• **Automatic policy creation** with timestamped names to avoid conflicts  \n",
    "• **Error handling** for existing roles and policies  \n",
    "• **Resource-specific permissions** (scoped to your SageMaker endpoint and ECR repositories)  \n",
    "• **Ready-to-use role ARN** for AgentCore configuration  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures your agent has exactly the permissions it needs to run securely in the AgentCore Runtime \n",
