    "This demo notebook demonstrate how you can scale in your SageMaker endpoint to zero instances during idle periods, eliminating the previous requirement of maintaining at least one running instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new [Scaling to Zero feature](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/unlock-cost-savings-with-the-new-scale-down-to-zero-feature-in-amazon-sagemaker-inference/) expands the possibilities for managing SageMaker Inference endpoints. It allows customers to configure the endpoints so they can scale to zero instances during periods of inactivity, providing an additional tool for resource management. Using this feature customers can closely match their compute resource usage to their actual needs, potentially reducing costs during times of low demand. This enhancement builds upon SageMaker's existing auto-scaling capabilities, offering more granular control over resource allocation. Customers can now configure their scaling policies to include scaling to zero, allowing for more precise management of their AI inference infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Scaling to Zero feature presents new opportunities for how businesses can approach their cloud-based machine learning operations. It provides additional options for managing resources across various scenarios, from development and testing environments to production deployments with variable traffic patterns. As with any new feature, customers are encouraged to carefully evaluate how it fits into their overall architecture and operational needs, considering factors such as response times and the specific requirements of their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining When to Scale Down to Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker's scale-to-zero capability is ideal for three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predictable traffic patterns:** If your inference traffic is predictable and follows a consistent schedule, you can use this scaling functionality to automatically scale in to zero during periods of low or no usage. This eliminates the need to manually delete and recreate inference components/endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sporadic workloads:** For applications that experience sporadic or variable inference traffic patterns, scaling in to zero instances can provide significant cost savings. However, it's important to note that scaling out from zero instances to serving traffic is not instantaneous. During the scale-out process, any requests sent to the endpoint will fail, and these \"NoCapacityInvocationFailures\" will be captured in CloudWatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Development and testing:** The scale-to-zero functionality is also beneficial when testing and evaluating new machine learning models. During model development and experimentation, you may create temporary inference endpoints to test different configurations. However, it's easy to forget to delete these endpoints when you're done. Scaling to zero ensures these test endpoints automatically scale in to zero instances when not in use, preventing unwanted charges. This allows you to freely experiment without closely monitoring infrastructure usage or remembering to manually delete endpoints. The automatic scaling to zero provides a cost-effective way to test out ideas and iterate on your machine learning solutions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Note:** Scale-to-zero is only supported when using inference components. for more information on Inference Components see “[Reduce model deployment costs by 50% on average using the latest features of Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reduce-model-deployment-costs-by-50-on-average-using-sagemakers-latest-features/)” blog.\n"
