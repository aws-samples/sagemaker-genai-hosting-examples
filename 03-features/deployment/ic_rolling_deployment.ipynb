It's free and has a lot of historical artifacts. Then there's the Tower of London, which is iconic with the Crown Jewels. Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament are also key, though they're more for the view than the buildings themselves. The London Eye is a modern attraction with great views of the city. \n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, I should mention the Tower Bridge too. It's a famous landmark, even if it's not as old as the Tower. The Sherlock Holmes Museum might be a good spot for fans of the detective stories. The National Gallery is another must, especially for art lovers. \n",
       "\n",
       "What about the Coca-Cola London Eye? Oh, right, that's the same as the London Eye. Maybe I should clarify that. The Trafalgar Square is a big area with Nelson's Column and the National Gallery nearby. The Westminster Abbey is important for historical and religious reasons. \n",
       "\n",
       "Oh, and the London Underground is a unique experience, even if it's not a place to visit. The British Library is another cultural spot. The South Bank area is lively with the River Thames and the Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. \n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, I should check if there are any other notable places. The Natural History Museum and Science Museum are popular. The Victoria and Albert Museum for art and design. The Shard is a modern skyscraper with a viewing platform. \n",
       "\n",
       "I need to make sure I'm not missing any major attractions. Maybe the Regent's Park for the London Zoo or the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Also, the Camden Market for shopping and food. \n",
       "\n",
       "I should structure this in a list, maybe with categories like historical, cultural, modern, and parks.
